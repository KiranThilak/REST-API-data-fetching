# REST API to fetch data with the useEffect hook

This project showcases how to fetch data from a REST API using the useEffect hook in React. By utilizing the useEffect hook, the application efficiently manages data fetching and rendering on the user interface.

## Project Description

The REST API Data Fetching project provides a practical example of fetching data from an external API and displaying it in a React application. The project utilizes the useEffect hook, a powerful feature in React that allows developers to manage side effects, such as data fetching, in functional components.

Key Features:

- **Efficient data fetching:** The project demonstrates how to initiate API calls using the useEffect hook. It ensures that data is fetched only when necessary and minimizes unnecessary re-rendering of components.

- **Error handling and loading states:** The application incorporates error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failed API requests. It also includes loading states to provide feedback to users while data is being fetched.

- **Rendered data display:** Fetched data is rendered on the user interface using React components and HTML elements. The project demonstrates best practices for displaying data in a table and visually appealing manner.
